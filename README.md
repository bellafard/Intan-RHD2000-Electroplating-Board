# Intan RHD2000 electroplating board enclosure STL files

The STL stereolithography files included in this repository can be used in conjunction with a 3D printer to fabricate a protective enclosure for the Intan RHD2000 Electroplating board. 

Any 3D printer or printing service with resolution better than 500 microns should be able to fabricate these parts. This enclosure has been successfully fabricated using a Ultimaker 2+ Extended 3D printer.

This design was developed independent of Intan Technologies.
